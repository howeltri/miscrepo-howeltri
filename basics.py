# Vars start with letter or underscore and then consist of only nums, letters, underscores
# They're case-sensitive... you know that right?
# snake_case is the naming convention, stop using camelCase :(
# vars like __var__ are private and should be left alone
# None = nothing ~ like null
# Double vs Single quotes = they actually don't matter which, I thought they did :(
# You'd just need to do like this "To say 'really...'" or this "to say 'really really.'"
# Escape chars ~ \n, \"
# multiplying *= 5
# f strings -  looks like f"this is the {x} time that's happened"
# vars have truthiness and falsiness - 1 is true 0, empty, None = false
# comparisons == != > < >= <=
# and or not
# == = is the value/s the same while is = is the memory location the same
